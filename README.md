NanoSpec.go
======

NanoSpec.go is a *minimal* [BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)-style testing framework for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/). Its purpose is to *bootstrap* other more advanced testing frameworks, while still enabling the writing of [specification-style](http://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html) tests. For use in regular programs [GoSpec](http://github.com/orfjackal/gospec) is recommended.

Source code is available at <http://github.com/orfjackal/nanospec.go>

Quick Start
-----------

Have a look at how [GoSpec](http://github.com/orfjackal/gospec) uses this framework and read the source code. This framework is not meant for beginners, but for testing framework developers. This can be used as a library in other testing frameworks for Go, or as an reference implementation of how to create a similar testing framework for some other language.
