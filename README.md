NanoSpec.Go
======

NanoSpec.Go is a *minimal* [BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)-style testing framework for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/). Its purpose is to bootstrap other more advanced testing frameworks, while still enabling the writing of [specification-style](http://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html) tests. For normal use [GoSpec](http://github.com/orfjackal/gospec) is recommended.
